> ‚ú® Beautifully shows Express/Koa/Hapi/Fastify routes in CLI.

![route-list CLI example](./screenshots/showcase.png)

## :package: Installation

```sh
# Installs the package so it's globally accessible in terminal
npm i route-list -g
```

## üîå Configuration

Before you can use `route-list` on your project, we first need to make sure it's configured properly.
In order for `route-list` to work, we need to export server "app".
The example below is for Express but it also applies to Koa (with @koa/router)/Hapi/Fastify as well.

**app.js** / **app.ts**

```js
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => res.sendStatus(200));
app.get('/products', (req, res) => res.sendStatus(200));
app.get('/products/:id', (req, res) => res.sendStatus(200));

// CJS
// Option 1: module.exports = app;
// Option 2: module.exports = { app, yourOtherExports... };

// ESM
// Option 1: export default app;
// Option 2: export default { app, yourOtherExports... };
```

> NOTE: In case you use [SocketIO with Express](https://socket.io/get-started/chat#the-web-framework), make sure to **export Express app**, not `http.createServer` server instance.

## :cloud: Usage

The project was inspired by new `route:list` command in Laravel 9.
New [`route:list`](https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/40269) itself was
inspired by [`pretty-routes`](https://github.com/Wulfheart/pretty-routes) project.
Big thanks to [Œõlex Wulf](https://twitter.com/alexfwulf) for building
`pretty-routes` and Laravel community for recognizing the usefulness of the project.
